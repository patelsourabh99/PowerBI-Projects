- **Wait Times**: Monitors average wait times and identifies potential bottlenecks in patient flow.
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Tracks patient satisfaction scores to gauge overall patient experience.
- **Referral Data**: Provides information on patient referrals and their sources.
- **Patient Demographics**: Analyzes patient demographics, including age, gender, and race.
- **Patient Admission Status**: Tracks the number of patients admitted and not admitted.
- **Department Referrals**: Identifies the departments referring the most patients.
- **Peak Busy Periods**: Highlights the busiest days and hours for emergency room visits.
